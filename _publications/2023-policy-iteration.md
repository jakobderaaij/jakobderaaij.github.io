title: "A Lower bound for Howardâ€™s Algorithm for Deterministic MDPs with Mean-payoff Objectives"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2023-policy-iteration
excerpt: 'We improve the worst-case lower bound on well-known policy iteration algorithm for Determinisitic Markov Decision Processes with a mean-payoff objective. We show that the worst-case number of iterations the algorithm takes is linear (up to logarithmic factors) in the input size, signifcantly improving on the previously known bound (square root of input size).'
