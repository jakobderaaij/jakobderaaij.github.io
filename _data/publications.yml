  excerpt: 'We improve the worst-case lower bound on the well-known Howard''s policy iteration algorithm for Determinisitic Markov Decision Processes with a mean-payoff objective. We show that the worst-case number of iterations the algorithm takes is linear (up to logarithmic factors) in the input size, signifcantly improving on the previously known bound (square root of input size).'
