I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Harvard University](https://seas.harvard.edu). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ariel D. Procaccia](https://procaccia.info).

Previously, I was a undergraduate student at MIT, where I got a major in [Mathematics with Computer Science](https://math.mit.edu/index.php) and a minor in [Art, Culture, and Technology](https://act.mit.edu). During the summer of 2023, I was a research intern at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/home/), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ista.ac.at/~kchatterjee/). I grew up in Vienna, Austria.
